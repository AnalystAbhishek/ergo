[Ergo Documentation][docsergo]

## About

This is the source code for the Ergo compiler. Ergo is the [Accord Project][apmain]
language for Smart Legal Contracts.

The Ergo compiler is distributed as an [npm package][npmpkg]. 
If you want to install Ergo, consult the [getting started][getstart] section.

The Ergo compiler is written in [Coq][coq] with a parser and
some support code written in [OCaml][OCaml]. It makes extensive use
of the [Q*cert compiler][Qcertcompiler] for code generation.

Both the Ergo language and its compiler are in early development
phase. If you would like to build from source or to contribute,
consult the [for developers][fordeve] section.

## Try it out

If you want to take a peek at Ergo without installing anything, check
out the interactive [REPL][REPL]
(read-eval-print-loop) for Ergo stand-alone, or the [Accord Project Template Studio][aptempstudio] 
showing how Ergo can express the logic of legal templates.

## Documentation

The most recent documentation for the Ergo language and compiler is
available at the [Ergo documentation][docsergo]

## Getting started

### Install Ergo

The easiest way to install Ergo is as a [Node.js][nodejs] package.
Once you have Node.js installed on your machine, you can get the Ergo compiler
and command-line using the Node.js package manager by typing the following in a
terminal:

```text
$ npm install -g @accordproject/ergo-cli
```

This will install the compiler itself (`ergoc`) and command-line tools (`ergorun` and `ergotop`) to create and invoke Ergo contracts. You can check that both have been installed and print the version number by typing the following in a terminal:

```text
$ ergoc --version
$ ergorun --version
```

Then, to get command line help:

```text
$ ergoc --help
$ ergorun --help
```

### Compiling your first contract

To compile your first Ergo contract to JavaScript:

```text
$ ergoc ./examples/volumediscount/model.cto ./examples/volumediscount/logic.ergo
15:17:08 - info: Logging initialized. 2018-05-24T19:17:08.024Z
Processing file: ./examples/volumediscount/logic.ergo -- compiled to: ./examples/volumediscount/logic.js
```

By default, Ergo compiles to JavaScript for execution. You can inspect
the compiled JavaScript code in `./examples/volumediscount/logic.js`

### Invoke a contract

To compile and execute a contract by sending a request:

```text
$ ergorun execute ./examples/volumediscount/model.cto ./examples/volumediscount/logic.ergo --contract ./examples/volumediscount/contract.json --request ./examples/volumediscount/request.json --state ./examples/volumediscount/state.json
06:40:01 - info:
{
  "response": {
    "discountRate": 2.8,
    "$class": "org.accordproject.volumediscount.VolumeDiscountResponse"
  },
  "state": {
    "$class": "org.accordproject.cicero.contract.AccordContractState",
    "stateId": "1"
  },
  "emit": []
}
```

To compile and invoke a specific contract clause:

```text
$ ergorun invoke ./examples/volumediscount/model.cto ./examples/volumediscount/logic.ergo --clauseName volumediscount --contract ./examples/volumediscount/contract.json --params ./examples/volumediscount/params.json --state ./examples/volumediscount/state.json
06:40:29 - info:
{
  "response": {
    "discountRate": 2.8,
    "$class": "org.accordproject.volumediscount.VolumeDiscountResponse"
  },
  "state": {
    "$class": "org.accordproject.cicero.contract.AccordContractState",
    "stateId": "1"
  },
  "emit": []
}
```

To compile and obtain the initial state for the contract:

```text
$ ergorun init ./examples/volumediscount/model.cto ./examples/volumediscount/logic.ergo --contract ./examples/volumediscount/contract.json
06:40:29 - info:
{
  "response": null,
  "state": {
    "stateId": "org.accordproject.cicero.contract.AccordContractState#1",
    "$class": "org.accordproject.cicero.contract.AccordContractState"
  },
  "emit": []
}
```
